TODOS:

- Matchmaking

- Fix interests devolving into multiple lists/string of list (can confirm it's being pulled from the backend as a list of a list, so it's not fucking up on our end)
When it first gets submitted, encodeJSON turns the List<String> into:
I/flutter (19245): String //runtimeType of encoded form
I/flutter (19245): ["Observation hobbies\r","Paintball\r","Performance\r","Pickleball\r","Ultimate frisbee\r","Jewelry making\r","Kabaddi\r"] //encoded form

- Fix name not being updated on PUT (also a backend problem)


Matching:
- Get all users for matching (initially, can filter client side if we have any time left)
- When they do swipe right, set a put request to update them in the server (adding new user to their matches)
- Also update their match list to include other user's account class, so that DM's can pull that data.

- Note: When testing singup form, if you reload with changes during the process, the account being edited will be emptied, although the data in the form will not since nothing is being rebuilt there.
	- Form will say it's not filled out when you try to advance. Just restart the app and try again. No problem during normal testing conditions.
