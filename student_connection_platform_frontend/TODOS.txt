Current work:
- Update validation to onUserInteraction and use booleans to determine if data is valid (when validation method succeeds, set true. If validation fails set false. Shouldn't need onChange)
- DOB validation currently doesn't work, doesn't allow/isn't acceptable for any valid date too
- Fix bottom app bar so it doesn't overlap with shit (should stay at the bottom when keyboard input shows up)
- Try to fix list view to either put them closer together and/or make the width match the parent and height fill the rest
- Move data to signup class and make sure all our data is valid if we want to submit
    - If not valid, alert dialog which page is wrong and the issue
    - If all valid, prepare for DB submission





Collection data signup page:
- Username (3+ chars)
- Email
- Password

Fix app name in:
- android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml - android:label = "NameTBD"
- ios/Runner/info.plist ->
	<key>CFBundleName</key>
	<string>NameTBD</string> //This one
