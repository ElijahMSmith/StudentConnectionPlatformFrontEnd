# KnightHacks Team 3 - Front End

This is the front end for our project, written in dart with Flutter to be compiled on either iOS or Android. The purpose of this project is to provide an avenue for students across the globe to connect with other like-minded students and share their experiences.

Our application provides matchmaking and direct messaging systems to allow students to connect with each other as they please and carry on long-term conversations to learn about students both locally and across other countries.

This project is still very much a WIP.

### A generalized list of what we've already accomplished:
- Fully functional login and signup processes
- User-initiated partial and full matchmaking with other users
- Profile information previews and the ability to update personal information

### Current focuses:
- Instant messaging DMs using websockets
- Profile images tied to accounts on the server
- More specific matchmaking and more user information on dispaly during matchmaking

### Long-term plans:
- Enhanced social aspect through posts and reply threads
- Improved stylization
- Performance improvements
- Code cleanup/standardization
